Here lies an attempt to document the firmware format for obi100/110 ATAs, obi200/202/302 ATAs, obi1022/1032/1062 ip phones, and obi504/508 ATAs and provide tools to manipulate the contents.

WARNING: obi recently added x509 certificate checks to the firmware upgrade routine of recent versions of stock firmware (5853+ for ATAs and 5-1-11-4858+ for phones), making it more difficult to upgrade to a custom firmware.
